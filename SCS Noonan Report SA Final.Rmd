# Introduction
SCS Noonan Scholars is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to helping high-achieving low-income underrepresented students get into and graduate from top colleges equipped to achieve their full career potential. This program was originally established in 2001 by philanthropists James and Patricia London under the name South Central Scholars, and began as a scholarship program serving a few high-achieving low-income students in the Los Angeles area. The program quickly grew in scope to include academic intervention, academic and social-emotional support, and career guidance and networking. In 2012, SCS conducted a pilot summer program ("Summer Academy") to ensure that all participating Scholars enter college with the prerequisite writing, math, and science skills needed to persist in their chosen majors. In 2014, this program was replicated in Boston, Massachusetts under the name Noonan Scholars and in 2017, the Los Angeles and Boston programs unified under the name SCS Noonan Scholars.


This report details the results of an independent analysis commissioned by SCS Noonan Scholars during July-August 2019. The purpose of this analysis is threefold:

#. To evaluate the impact of the SCS Noonan Scholars Program since 2012.
#. To quantify the effects of attending Summer Academy on Scholars' academic performance.
#. To document additional observations and recommendations for future development.

The analysis was conducted by Dr. R. Jordan Crouser. Dr. Crouser earned his doctorate in Computer Science from Tufts University in 2013, and has held academic and research positions in both Statistical & Data Science and Computer Science. He served as an instructor at Summer Academy during 2018 and 2019.

# About the Data

Two datasets were furnished by SCS Noonan Scholars for the purposes of this analysis. 


## Scholar Metadata (\texttt{Scholar Metadata.csv})

The first dataset contains a variety of demographic and summary academic performance measurements on 1029 individual participating Scholars from 2012 to 2020. From this collection, 66 were removed from the analysis due to missing or incomplete data, resulting in a final dataset reflecting 608 current Scholars and 355 program alumni. To preserve Scholars' privacy, names and contact information have been omitted from this analysis. Throughout the remainder of this document, the term \textbf{cohort} (labeled with a year, e.g. "the 2019 cohort") will be used to refer to the group of Scholars who graduated high school in that year. For detailed information regarding the other measures in this dataset, see Appendix I.

### General Characteristics at a Glance
- An average of 107 Scholars were accepted into each of the 2012-2020 cohorts.

```{r cohortSize, eval = FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

- Out of the 963 Scholars in the dataset:

    - 945 (98.1%) come from families whose income is at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Level.
```{r fpl, eval = FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%
  mutate(under400 = `Federal Poverty Level Percentage` <= 400) %>%
  group_by(under400) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = under400, value = n) %>%
  rename(`<=400% FPL` = `TRUE`, `>=400% FPL` = `FALSE`) %>%
  mutate(perc = `<=400% FPL` / (`<=400% FPL` + `>=400% FPL`))
```

    - 757 (79.0%) are first-generation college students.
```{r 1stgen, eval = FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%

  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = `First Generation College Student`, value = n) %>%
  mutate(`1stgen Ratio` = `1` / `0`,
         perc = `1` / (`1` + `0`)) %>%
  pander()
```

    - 582 (60.5%) are female, yielding a sex ratio of 1.532.
```{r genderRatio, eval = FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = Gender, value = n) %>%
  mutate(`Gender Ratio` = Female / Male,
         perc = Female / (Female + Male)) %>%

  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = `Asian`, value = n) %>%
  mutate(perc = `1` / (`1` + `0`)) %>%
  pander()
```

### High School GPA
The SCS Noonan Scholars program is becoming increasingly competitive. Data regarding High School GPA at time of admission was tracked beginning in 2016:

- In 2016, the average High School GPA was **3.71**.
- This average has **increased every year since that time**. 
- The average High School GPA for the most recent 2020 cohort is **3.93**.

Table \ref{table:HS-gpa} illustrates the year-by-year trend in Scholar's high school GPA upon admission. _Note: the \texttt{\% missing} column indicates how many Scholars in each cohort are missing a value for this measure in the dataset._

```{r GPA-upon-admission}
# ISSUE: This is unweighted: there are 2 Scholars with a GPA > 4.0, can we assume everyone else is on a 4.0-scale?
GPA_at_admission_summary = scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort >= 2016) %>%   # We didn't reliably track this until 2016,
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(`Average HS Unweighted GPA` = round(mean(`HS Unweighted GPA`, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
            sd = sd(`HS Unweighted GPA`, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n(),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`HS Unweighted GPA`)) / n)) %>%
  # mutate(se = sd / sqrt(n),
  #        lower.ci = `Average HS Unweighted GPA` - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n - 1) * se,
  #        upper.ci = `Average HS Unweighted GPA` + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n - 1) * se,
  #        `95% CI` = paste("[ ", signif(lower.ci, 3), ", ", signif(upper.ci, 3)," ]", sep = "")) %>%
  select(Cohort, 
         `Average HS Unweighted GPA`, 
         #`95% CI`, 
         `% missing`)

GPA_at_admission_summary %>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:HS-gpa}Average HS Unweighted GPA at Admission")
```

The density plot in Figure 1 highlights the changing distribution of Scholars' High School GPA upon admission each year beginning in 2016. The distribution is becoming increasingly right-skewed over time: the average is getting higher, and the difference between the lowest- and highest-performing students is getting smaller.

```{r HS_gpa_density, fig.height = 2.5, fig.align = "left"}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort >= 2016,   # We didn't reliably track this until 2016
         `HS Unweighted GPA` > 0) %>%        # Filter out "0" GPA (actually missing)
  ggplot(aes(x = `HS Unweighted GPA`, fill = as.factor(Cohort))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_vline( data = GPA_at_admission_summary, 
              aes(xintercept = GPA_at_admission_summary$`Average HS Unweighted GPA`,
                  color = as.factor(Cohort)), 
              linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(data = GPA_at_admission_summary, 
            aes(x = GPA_at_admission_summary$`Average HS Unweighted GPA`,
                y = 5.5, angle=90, vjust = -0.5,
                color = as.factor(Cohort),
                label = paste("mean =",GPA_at_admission_summary$`Average HS Unweighted GPA`)),
            size = 2.5) +
  xlab("Fig. 1 Average High School GPA upon Admission to SCS Noonan Scholars") +      # Label the x-axis
  ylab("Density") +     # Label the y-axis`
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  facet_grid(~Cohort) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE,
         color = FALSE)
```

### High School SAT Scores
The average SAT Percentile is also steadily increasing: 

- For the 2012 cohort, the mean score was in the **78th percentile**.
- For the 2019 cohort, the mean score was in the **86th percentile**.

Table \ref{table:SAT-by-cohort} captures the historic trend toward higher SAT scores with each new cohort. This data was generated by cross-referencing each Scholar's reported total SAT score with the percentile ranges provided by the College Board for the year in which the examination was taken.

```{r SAT_percentile}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020) %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(`Average SAT Percentile` = signif(mean(`SAT Percentile`, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
            sd = sd(`SAT Percentile`, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n(),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`SAT Percentile`)) / n)) %>%
  select(Cohort, 
         `Average SAT Percentile`, 
         #`95% CI`, 
         `% missing`)%>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:SAT-by-cohort}Average Composite SAT Percentile, by Cohort")
```

The boxplot in Figure 2 illustrates the spread of SAT Percentile by cohort. Note that the only statistically significant year-over-year difference was between the 2016 and 2017 cohorts.

```{r SAT_boxplot, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6.3, fig.align = "left"}
my_comparisons <- list(c("2016", "2017"))

SAT_median_scores = scholar_metadata %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(med = median(`SAT Percentile`, na.rm = T),
            label = paste(med, "th", sep = "")) %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020)

scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `SAT Percentile`, x = factor(`Cohort`))) +
  geom_jitter(pch = 21, size = .5, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.3)  +   # Add original datapoints (jittered)
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.7) +                   # Hide outliers so they don't double-plot
  geom_text(data = SAT_median_scores, aes(x = factor(Cohort), y = med, label = label), 
              size = 2.5, vjust = 1.4) +
  xlab("Fig. 2 Distribution of SAT Percentile by Cohort") +                      # Label the x-axis
  ylab("SAT Percentile") + # Label the y-axis
  ylim(c(0,110)) +
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, aes(label=..p.signif..)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times"))
  

```

### Income Levels

More than 98% of Scholars have had family incomes at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Level during each of the previous 3 cohorts, and 6 out of the last 9 cohorts (Table \ref{table:income}).

```{r FPL}
scholar_metadata %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(`% of Scholars w/ Family Income < 200% FPL` = percent(sum(`Federal Poverty Level Percentage` <= 200)/n()),
            `% of Scholars w/ Family Income < 400% FPL` = percent(sum(`Federal Poverty Level Percentage` <= 400)/n()),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`Federal Poverty Level Percentage`)) / n())) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(10, 20, 20, 20),
         caption = "\\label{table:income}% of Scholars, by % Federal Poverty Level and Cohort" )
```

The average family income has been **below $40,000** for each cohort since 2012. 

```{r average_income}
scholar_metadata %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(`Average Family Income` = signif(mean(`Family Income`, na.rm = TRUE), 5),
            sd = sd(`Family Income`, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n(),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`Family Income`)) / n)) %>%
  # mutate(se = sd / sqrt(n),
  #        lower.ci = `Average Family Income` - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n - 1) * se,
  #        upper.ci = `Average Family Income` + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n - 1) * se,
  #        `95% CI` = paste("[ ", dollar(signif(lower.ci, 5)), ", ", dollar(signif(upper.ci, 5))," ]", sep = "")) %>%
  select(Cohort, 
         `Average Family Income`, 
         # `95% CI`, 
         `% missing`)%>%
  mutate(`Average Family Income` = dollar(`Average Family Income`)) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(10, 20, 20),
         caption = "Average Family Income, by Cohort")
```

### Race and Ethnicity

Across all cohorts:

- **31.5%** of Scholars identify as Black or African American.
- **53.0%** of Scholars identify as Hispanic or Latinx.
- **81.3%** of Scholars identify as one or more of Black, African American, Hispanic or Latinx.
- **78.6%** are first-generation college students.


```{r blackOrLatinx}

This dataset contains detailed information on 767 unique Scholars from the 2012-2018 cohorts regarding their performance in 20,649 individual courses throughout their college career. Of the unmatched students in the \texttt{Scholar Metadata} dataset, 192 are from the 2019 and 2020 cohorts (and so have not yet completed their first semester of college). 

The following summary statistics report only on those Scholars who have completed at least one semester of college. For detailed information regarding the measures in this dataset, see Appendix II.

### General Characteristics at a Glance
- Scholars took an average of **4.05** courses each term.

- Table \ref{table:average-courseload} breaks this down by individual terms. We observed a heavier load during the traditional Fall and Spring semesters, with a lighter courseload during Summer and Winter terms across all cohorts, with the 2018 cohort taking a heavier overall courseload than any previous cohort:

# Impact of the SCS Noonan Scholars Program

In the following sections, we report on the overall impact the SCS Noonan Scholars Program has had on participating Scholars, and how that has evolved over the past 8 years. 

## Where SCS Noonan Scholars Attend College
Scholars are enrolling in increasingly selective colleges and universities. The 2019 cohort saw a dramatic shift in the caliber of postsecondary institutions into which Scholars ultimately enrolled (Table \ref{table-topschools}). More than **1 in 4 Scholars** in the 2019 cohort will be attending Ivy-Plus institutions[^1] in the Fall of 2019, and over **90%** will be attending a Top-100 institution.

[^1]: The Ivy-Plus institutions are a collection of elite colleges and universities esteemed for their academic and professional excellence, intellectual curiosity, leadership and civic engagement. The twelve schools under this designation are: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College,  Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania,  Princeton University, Yale University, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, Duke University.

```{r top100schools}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020) %>% # This cohort has not yet applied to college
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  summarise(`% attending Ivy-Plus School` = percent(sum(IvyPlus)/n()),
            `% attending Top-100 School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` <= 100, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`)) / n())) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(10, 10, 10, 10),
         caption = "\\label{table-topschools}% Scholars Attending Top Schools, by Cohort")
```


Scholars attend a wide variety of different colleges and universities (Table \ref{table:top-3-schools-by-cohort}). California institutions dominated the landscape in the early years of the program, shifting after the program went national in 2018.

## Major Distribution

Of the 902 Scholars that indicated an intended major, **516 (57.2%) intended to major in STEM fields**. Of these:

 - 285 were female/non-binary (52.3% of Scholars coded as female/non-binary with an intended major). 
 - 271 identify as Hispanic or Latinx (57.3% of Hispanic or Latinx Scholars with an intended major).

## Scholar Graduation Rate
The six-year college graduation rate of the Scholars contained in the provided datasets is **98.2%** (calculated for 2012 and 2013 cohorts only), and the four-year graduation rate is **83.3%**. Table \ref{table:4yr-grad-rate} breaks this figure down by cohort, and was prepared using a Scholar's status (\texttt{Scholar Alumni} or \texttt{Current Scholar}) as an indicator of whether or not they had completed their degree. Scholars in cohorts later than 2015 have not yet reported their degrees, and so are omitted from this analysis. The \texttt{\% missing} column details the proportion of Scholars in each cohort whose listed \texttt{College Graduation Year} is 2019 or earlier, but whose degrees have not yet been confirmed.

# Impact of Summer Academy on Academic Performance {#impact-overall}

## The Origin of Summer Academy

Several years into the development of the program, organizers observed that a nontrivial number of Scholars were transitioning out of their intended majors after struggling academically during their Freshman year. Specifically, they were concerned by the perceived trend that Scholars were abandoning traditionally rigorous majors about which they felt passionate, and moving into fields of study in which they believed they could achieve a higher GPA regardless of whether that discipline held their interest. 

The organizers hypothesized that a gap in academic preparedness was in part responsible for Scholars' early challenges in collegiate environments, specifically in the areas of mathematics and writing. The Summer Academy program was launched in 2012 in an effort to bridge this gap. In this section, we attempt to quantify the impact of this program with respect to Scholars' post-secondary academic performance.

Table \ref{table:SA-participation} illustrates the growth of participation in the Summer Academy program since its inception in 2012. In earlier years, each cohort was triaged to identify Scholars who would most benefit from additional support through this program. The 2012 cohort, which was the first cohort to participate in Summer Academy, only had the opportunity to attend a single session prior to leaving for college. In later years,  all Scholars were strongly encouraged to attend, and some had the opportunity to attend a second session.

```{r SA_participation}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020) %>%
  group_by(Cohort, `# SA Cohorts`) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = `# SA Cohorts`, value = n) %>%
  mutate(SA0perc = `0` / sum(`0`,`1`,`2`, na.rm = T),
         SA1perc = `1` / sum(`0`,`1`,`2`, na.rm = T),
         SA2perc = `2` / sum(`0`,`1`,`2`, na.rm = T),
         `0` = ifelse(!is.na(`0`), 
                  paste(`0`, " Scholars (", percent(SA0perc, 2), ")", sep = ""),            
                  NA),

                  paste(`1`, " Scholars (", percent(SA1perc, 2), ")", sep = ""), 
                  NA),
         `2` = ifelse(!is.na(`2`), paste(`2`, " Scholars (", percent(SA2perc, 2), ")", sep = ""), NA))%>%
  rename(`Did not attend Summer Academy` = `0`,
         `Attended 1 Session of Summer Academy` = `1`,
         `Attended 2 Sessions of Summer Academy` = `2`) %>%
  select(-SA0perc, -SA1perc, -SA2perc) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(7,15,15,15),
         caption = "\\label{table:SA-participation}Participation in Summer Academy, by Cohort")
```

During their first session of Summer Academy, all Scholars took one course in Calculus-based mathematics and one course in college-level writing. Beginning in 2014, those that attended a second session in Los Angeles had the option to select a Chemistry elective in lieu of either mathematics of writing. In 2015, a second elective in Computer Science was added. In 2018, the Chemistry elective was discontinued.

```{r electives, eval=FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort >= 2014,
         Cohort <= 2018) %>%
  group_by(Cohort) %>%
  #filter(`# SA Cohorts` == 2) %>%
  summarise(`Number in Cohort` = n(),
            `Opted-In to Chemistry` = sum(`SA Chemistry`),
            `Opted-In to CS` = ifelse(sum(`SA Computer Science`)>0,sum(`SA Computer Science`), NA )) %>%
  pander()
```



## Confounding Factors
The question of whether or not participation in Summer Academy is correlated with improved post-secondary outcomes is somewhat complex, due in large part to the absence of an appropriate control group:

- Because Scholars in this program are statistical outliers in their academic achievement prior to their enrollment, and because systemic racism and classism heavily influence access to education, **comparison with national averages** for students with similar socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic demographics is not appropriate.
- Because they attend such a wide variety of postsecondary institutions (many of which have historically had substantial underrepresentation of low income students and students of color), a **comparison with similar students at the same institution** is not possible.
- Because the program has evolved so much in the past several years, even a **comparison between Scholars who did and did not attend Summer Academy** can prove problematic if not approached with care.

For example, because of the targeted recruitment strategy for earlier cohorts and the later shift toward required participation for all Scholars, the probability that an individual Scholar participated in Summer Academy grows each year (regardless of other factors). The logistic regression line in Figure 3 captures this pattern. 

_Note: for illustrative purposes, each black point represents an individual Scholar from the cohort, and the position encodes the true outcome: if the Scholar attended Summer Academy then the corresponding point appears at 100%, and if the Scholar did not attend Summer Academy, then the point appears at 0%._ 

\vspace{0.5em}

```{r PR_attend_SA_cohort, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 6.3, fig.align = "left"}
# Each year, the probability of attending SA increases
scholar_metadata %>%
  mutate(`Attended SA?` = ifelse(`# SA Cohorts` > 0, 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2020) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Cohort, y=`Attended SA?`)) + 
    geom_point(position = position_jitter(w = 0.2, h = 0.02), pch = 21, size = 0.2) + 
    stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"))+
    ylab(NULL)+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1), expand=c(0,0.05)) +
  xlab("Fig. 3 Logistic Regression: Probability of Attending SA by Cohort") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times"))
```

Similarly, for the first several years of the program, Scholars were selected for participation in Summer Academy specifically because they needed additional support. This suggests that in the years where Summer Academy was optional (prior to the 2019 Cohort), the probability that an individual Scholar participates in Summer Academy would decrease the more academically-prepared they were at the time of recruitment. The Scholar's performance on standardized testing could serve as one proxy measure for this (Figure 4).

\vspace{0.5em}

```{r PR_attend_SA_cohort_SAT, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 6.3, fig.align = "left"}
# SAT up, SA down
scholar_metadata %>%
  mutate(`Attended SA?` = ifelse(`# SA Cohorts` > 0, 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2019,
         `SAT Percentile` > 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=(`SAT Percentile`), y=`Attended SA?`)) + 
    geom_point(position = position_jitter(w = 0.2, h = 0.02), pch = 21, size = 0.2) + 
    stat_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"))+
    ylab(NULL)+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1), expand=c(0,0.05)) +
  xlab("Fig. 4 Logistic Regression: Probability of Attending SA by SAT Percentile") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times"))
``` 

However, this isn't quite the whole story:

 - Using Pearson's method we also observe a **weak positive correlation** (0.1924, p < 0.0001) between SAT Percentile and Reported Total GPA: as SAT scores increase, so does college GPA.

```{r SAT_vs_GPA, eval = F}
scholar_metadata %>%
  select(`SAT Percentile`, `Reported Total GPA`) %>%
  drop_na()  %$% # thanks magrittr!
  cor.test(`SAT Percentile`, `Reported Total GPA`) %>%
  pander(caption = "Pearson's correlation between SAT Percentile and GPA",
         split.cells = c(10, 10,15,10,10))
```

 - Intuitively, there is also **moderate negative correlation** between SAT scores and College Ranking (-0.4166, p < 0.0001): as SAT scores increase, the Scholar's chosen college is ranked closer to number 1.

```{r SAT_vs_SchoolRank, eval = F}
scholar_metadata %>%
  select(`SAT Percentile`, `College Forbes Ranking 2018`) %>%
  drop_na()  %$% # thanks magrittr!
  cor.test(`SAT Percentile`, `College Forbes Ranking 2018`) %>%
  pander(caption = "Pearson's correlation between SAT Percentile and College Ranking",
         split.cells = c(10, 10,15,10,10))
```

 - However, we also observe is a **weak negative correlation** between (the log of) College Ranking and a Scholar's GPA (-0.1739, p < 0.0001): as the school's ranking gets closer to 1, their GPA goes down. 

```{r SchoolRank_vs_GPA, eval = F}
scholar_metadata %>%
  select(`Reported Total GPA`, `College Forbes Ranking 2018`) %>%
  drop_na()  %$% # thanks magrittr!
  cor.test(log10(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`), `Reported Total GPA`) %>%
  pander(caption = "Pearson's correlation between GPA and College Ranking",
         split.cells = c(10, 10,15,10,10))
```

This implies that while higher SAT scores predispose a Scholar to enrolling in a higher-ranked college, as well as indicate prior preparation that equips them to do better on average in school than someone with a lower score, the decision to attend a higher-ranked school is related to lower overall GPAs. Because of the interrelationship between the aforementioned variables, the subsequent analysis will attempt to capture the impact of Summer Academy **in the context of** these factors rather than in isolation.

## Impact on Overall Academic Performance
In this  section, we consider the relationship between participation in Summer Academy and general academic performance in college. For this analysis, we will consider only Scholars whose status is listed as \texttt{Scholar Alumni}. When we account for each Scholar's SAT Percentile as well as the selectivity of their College:

- We observe **a statistically significant relationship between the number of sessions of Summer Academy a Scholar attends and their overall performance in college** ($p<0.00001$). 
- The coefficient suggests that we would expect to see **an average increase of 0.058** in overall GPA upon graduation for those who attend one session of Summer Academy, and **an average increase of 0.193** for those who attend two sessions of Summer Academy.
- For **female Scholars**, these gains are even more substantial: we would expect to see **an average increase of 0.128** in overall GPA upon graduation for those who attend one session of Summer Academy, and **an average increase of 0.253** for those who attend two sessions of Summer Academy ($p < 0.0001$).
- Scholars who identify as **Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx** reap benefits comparable to the overall collection of Scholars: we would expect to see **an average increase of 0.053** in overall GPA upon graduation for those who attend one session of Summer Academy, and **an average increase of 0.206** for those who attend two sessions of Summer Academy.

## Impact on Mathematics Performance

### Overall Mathematics Performance

We observe several patterns in Scholar's performance in mathematics courses across **all years of college** (Table \ref{table:math-performance}):

- Scholars who participated in Summer Academy **enrolled in Calculus I** at some point in their college careers at a higher rate than those who did not participate in Summer Academy.
- Scholars **earned a B or above more frequently in all categories of mathematics** when they had taken at least one session of Summer Academy.
- Scholars also **earned a B+ or above more frequently in all categories of mathematics** when they had taken at least one session of Summer Academy.
- Those gains were most striking in higher level mathematics courses (levels C and above), but this may be an artifact of relatively small $n$.

### Freshman Performance in the Introductory Calculus Series

In this section, we consider the relationship between participation in Summer Academy and performance in the introductory Calculus series: Calculus I and 2. Table \ref{table:calc-enrollment} demonstrates that enrollment in the introductory Calculus series during Freshman year was robust across all cohorts through 2017 (the most recent cohort for which complete data is available on Summer Academy participation).

A total of 379 unique Scholars took a total of 577 introductory Calculus courses during their Freshman year:

- They earned an average course GPA of 2.75. 
- They had a pass rate of 94.3%
- 50.8% of attempts earned a B or above 
- 34.3% of attempts earned a B+ or above
- 24.4% of attempts earned an A- or above.

Of these Scholars:

- 267 attended one session of Summer Academy.
- 114 attended two sessions of Summer Academy.
- 196 did not attend Summer Academy. 

Table \ref{table:calc-freshman-fall} demonstrates the **modest increase in the proportion of Scholars attempting Calculus I**  during their first semester of college when they were exposed to Calculus during Summer Academy, as well as an **increase in the proportion of Scholars earning grades in each of the following three categories: B or above, B+ or above, and A**.

                                    !(`Course Grade` == "Pass/Credit")),

The dataset includes records of 8,320 STEM courses taken by 630 unique Scholars. Scholars earned an **average course GPA of 2.81**, with a **pass rate of 94.4%**, with **51.4% of Scholars earning a B or higher** and **35.1% earning a B+ or higher**. Of these Scholars:

- 126 attended two sessions of Summer Academy.
- 344 attended one session of Summer Academy.
- 260 did not attend Summer Academy. 

Controlling for differences in academic preparedness (using SAT Math score as a proxy) and institutional rigor, we observe a **statistically significant relationship ($p < 0.05$) between Scholars' performance in STEM courses and their participation in Summer Academy**. Specifically, the coefficient suggests that we would expect to see **an average increase of 0.042** in their GPA in STEM courses for those who attend one session of Summer Academy, and **an average increase of 0.082** for those who attend Summer Academy for a second session.

### Incidence of STEM Majors and STEM Persistence

Scholars who attended Summer Academy were no more likely to intend to major in STEM than those who did not attend (Table \ref{table:intended-STEM-SA}):

```{r}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni") %>%
  mutate(`Intended Major STEM?` = factor(`Intended Major STEM?`, 
                                         labels = c("Intended non-STEM or Undeclared", 
                                                    "Intended STEM Major")),
         `# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No Summer Academy", "1 Session", "2 Sessions"))) %>%
  group_by(`# SA Cohorts`, `Intended Major STEM?`) %>%

  pander(split.cells = c(20, 20, 20),
         caption = "\\label{table:intended-STEM-SA}Prevalence of Intended STEM Major")
```

Nor were they more likely to ultimately major in STEM (Table \ref{table:current-STEM-SA}):

```{r}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni") %>%
  mutate(`Current Major STEM?` = factor(`Current Major STEM?`, 
                                        levels = c("#N/A", 0, 1),
                                         labels = c("Current non-STEM or Undeclared",
                                                    "Current non-STEM or Undeclared", 
                                                    "Current STEM Major")),
         `# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No Summer Academy", "1 Session", "2 Sessions"))) %>%
  group_by(`# SA Cohorts`, `Current Major STEM?`) %>%
  summarise(nMajors = n()) %>%

  pander(split.cells = c(20, 20, 20),
         caption = "\\label{table:current-STEM-SA}Prevalence of STEM Major")
```

Table \ref{table:STEM-persistence} considers **only those Scholars who have completed their degree**. There is no evidence of a relationship between the number of SA Cohorts a Scholar attends and the rate at which they persist in STEM (when controlling for SAT Math scores and College Forbes Ranking).

```{r STEMpersistence_by_nSA}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni", 
         `STEM Persistence` %in% c("Persisted in STEM", "Dropped STEM")) %>%

  spread(key = `STEM Persistence`, value = n) %>%

         `% Persisted in STEM` = percent(`Persisted in STEM` / (`Persisted in STEM` + `Dropped STEM`))) %>%
  
  select(-`Dropped STEM`, -`Persisted in STEM`) %>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:STEM-persistence}STEM Persistence",
         split.cells = c(10,10,30))
```

```{r eval = F}

summary(glm(`STEM Persistence` ~ `# SA Cohorts` + `SAT Math` + `College Forbes Ranking 2018`, data = intendedSTEMalums, family = "binomial"))
```

## Impact on Women in STEM

_Note: due to limitations in data collection, the following analysis considers only binary \texttt{Male} / \texttt{Female} sex designations._

Attendance at Summer Academy had opposing effects on intention to major in STEM for male and female Scholars. Male Scholars were **more** likely to intend to major in STEM the more sessions of Summer Academy they attended, while female Scholars were **less** likely to have an intended STEM major (Table \ref{table:intended-STEM-gender}):

```{r}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni") %>%
  mutate(`# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No Summer Academy", "1 Session", "2 Sessions"))) %>%
  group_by(`Gender`, `# SA Cohorts`, `Intended Major STEM?`) %>%
  summarise(nMajors = n()) %>%
  transmute(`Intended Major STEM?`, prop = percent(nMajors/sum(nMajors))) %>%
  spread(`Intended Major STEM?`, prop) %>%
  rename("% Scholars with Intended non-STEM Major" = `0`, "% Scholars Intended STEM Major" = `1`) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(20, 25, 25),
         caption = "\\label{table:intended-STEM-gender}Prevalence of Intended STEM Major, by Sex")
```

We observe the same pattern in major upon graduation (Table \ref{table:grad-STEM-gender}):

```{r}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni",
         `Current Major STEM?` != "<N/A>") %>%
  mutate(`Current Major STEM?` = factor(`Current Major STEM?`, 
                                        levels = c("#N/A", 0, 1),
                                         labels = c("Graduated non-STEM Major",
                                                    "Graduated non-STEM Major", 
                                                    "Graduated STEM Major"))) %>%
  mutate(`# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No Summer Academy", "1 Session", "2 Sessions"))) %>%
  group_by(`Gender`, `# SA Cohorts`, `Current Major STEM?`) %>%
  summarise(nMajors = n()) %>%
  transmute(`Current Major STEM?`, prop = percent(nMajors/sum(nMajors))) %>%
  spread(`Current Major STEM?`, prop) %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(20, 25, 25, 25),
         caption = "\\label{table:grad-STEM-gender}Prevalence of STEM Major upon Graduation, by Sex")
```


Table \ref{table:STEM-persistence-sex} considers **only those Scholars who have completed their degree and who intended to major in STEM**. For Scholars who intended to major in STEM, the **rate of persistence** for female Scholars who had attended two sessions of Summer Academy was comparable to that of their male counterparts.

\newpage

```{r womenSTEMpersistence_by_nSA}
scholar_metadata %>%
  mutate(`# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No Summer Academy", "1 Session", "2 Sessions"))) %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status`== "Scholar Alumni", 
         `STEM Persistence` %in% c("Persisted in STEM", "Dropped STEM")) %>%
  group_by(`# SA Cohorts`,  `Gender`, `STEM Persistence`) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(key = `STEM Persistence`, value = n) %>%
  mutate(`Dropped STEM` = replace_na(`Dropped STEM`, 0),
         `% Persisted in STEM` = percent(`Persisted in STEM` / (`Persisted in STEM` + `Dropped STEM`)))%>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:STEM-persistence-sex}STEM Persistence, by # SA and Sex",
         split.cells = c(10, 10, 20, 20,20))
```

This pattern merits further investigation: it is possible that the reason for this leveled persistence is that female Scholars are disproportionately deterred from intending to major in STEM, and so those that remain are predisposed to be more perseverant.

## Impact of the Chemistry Elective

From 2014-2018, an optional Chemistry elective was offered during Summer Academy. On average, roughly 17.5% of Scholars in each cohort who attended Summer Academy opted into this elective (a total of 74 Scholars over five years, Table \ref{table:took-SA-chem}).
```{r}

A total of 247 unique Scholars took a total of 518 Chemistry courses during their Freshman year, earning an average course GPA of 2.74, with a pass rate of 94.2% and with 44.8% of Scholars earning a B or higher. Of these Scholars, 51 had taken the Chemistry elective during Summer Academy, 139 attended Summer Academy but did not take the Chemistry elective, and 97 did not attend Summer Academy. Controlling for differences in academic preparedness (using SAT Math score as a proxy), there appears to be **no significant relationship between Scholars' performance in those courses and whether or not they were exposed to Chemistry during Summer Academy** (Figure 5).

_Note: the latter comparison is likely subject to some selection bias: Scholars attending Summer Academy who were planning to take a Chemistry course in college may have been more likely to opt into the Chemistry elective. We not to have sufficient data to support or refute this hypothesis._

## Impact of the Computer Science Elective

Beginning in 2016, an optional Computer Science Elective was offered during Summer Academy. On average, roughly 18.1% of Scholars in each cohort (a total of 49 Scholars over two years, Table \ref{table:CS-elective}) opted into this elective. In 2019, all second session Scholars were required to take Computer Science.

A total of 138 unique Scholars from the 2016-2019 cohorts took a Computer Science course during their Freshman year, earning an average course GPA of 2.89, with a pass rate of 92.2% and with 51.1% of Scholars earning a B or higher. Of these Scholars, 23 took the Computer Science elective during Summer Academy, 78 attended Summer Academy but did not take the Computer Science elective, and 37 did not attend Summer Academy. Controlling for differences in academic preparedness (using SAT Group as a proxy), there appears to be **no significant relationship between Scholars' performance in those courses and whether or not they were exposed to Computer Science during Summer Academy** (Figure 6).

## Impact on College Access

In 2018-2019, Summer Academy transitioned from a day program to a residential model, beginning with the Scholars at the Amherst site in 2018 (approximately half of the incoming Scholars in the 2019 cohort) and moving to a fully-residential progranm at both sites in 2019. The decision to host the residential pilot at Amherst College was due in part to a perceieved benefit to exposing Scholars to a collegiate environment that was different from the larger city universities toward which Scholars tended to gravitate. It was hypothesized that this inclination might be in part an issue of of awareness, and that this exposure might in turn encourage Scholars to apply to schools in this class: small, rural, elite institutions.

Table \ref{table:recent-SA-top-colleges} compares the Top-enrolled institutions for Scholars who participated in a non-residential Summer Academy with those who attended the residential pilot.

```

According to SCS Noonan Scholars, rising high school seniors who were part of the residential Summer Academy also had many more college admissions workshops, opportunities to meet with their College Access coach one-on-one, and participated in 6 or more visits to Top-100 colleges. In addition, they left Summer Academy with a list of the colleges to which they planned to apply, a completed draft of their college application essay, and their common application completed. 

Table \ref{table:recent-SA-college-rank} compares the rate at which Scholars with non-residential Summer Academy enrolled in top-ranked institutions with those who attended the residential model.

```{r}
rbind(nonResScholars %>%
  summarise(Group = "Non-Residential SA as a Junior",
            `% attending Ivy-Plus School` = percent(sum(IvyPlus)/n()),
            `% attending Top-50 School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` <= 50, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% attending Top-100 School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` <= 100, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% attending Lower-Ranked School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` > 100, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`)) / n())),

residentialScholars %>%
  summarise(Group = "Residential SA as a Junior",

            `% attending Top-50 School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` <= 50, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% attending Top-100 School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` <= 100, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% attending Lower-Ranked School` = percent(sum(`College Forbes Ranking 2018` > 100, na.rm = TRUE)/n()),
            `% missing` = percent(sum(is.na(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`)) / n()))
)   %>%
  pander(split.cells = c(40,10, 10, 10, 10,10),
         caption = "\\label{table:recent-SA-college-rank}Scholars Attending Top Schools, Residential vs. non-Residential SA")


```

The difference is striking. In particular, Scholars who attended the residential model:

- Enrolled in an Ivy-Plus institution **3.2 times as often** than those who attended the non-residential model.
- Enrolled in a Top-50 ranked institution **1.4 times as often**.
- Enrolled in a Top-100 ranked institution **1.1 times as often**.

While we do not have sufficient data to assert that the shift in model is responsible for these changes, we can rule out several potential confounding factors. Scholars in both models (2018 and 2019 cohorts):

- Had comparable SAT Percentiles (83.50 ± 10.89 for non-residential, 86.27	± 10.43 for residential)
- Had comparable High School GPAs (3.80	± 0.18 for non-residential, 3.87 ± 0.16 for residential)
- Had comparable income levels (134.27%FPL ± 76.21% for non-residential, 141.68% ± 78.03% for residential)

However, Scholars participating in the residential program were recruited from a national pool, which would likely have influenced their awareness of a larger variety of postsecondary institutions. It will be interesting to continue to monitor the influence of the residential model in future cohorts.

# Recommendations and Future Directions

The preceeding analysis has demonstrated that on average, the Summer Academy program has a significant positive impact on participating Scholars' academic performance. It is important to note, however, that this is just one factor in the complex narrative of Scholar's college experience. In order to achieve the program's objectives, we must look deeply at the ways in which Scholars may not benefit equally from what the program has to offer, and to collect additional data in service of that investigation.

## The Role of Prior Preparation

We have found in many of the previous models that a Scholar's prior preparation (as evidenced by their performance on SATs, e.g.) plays an important role in predicting their academic success in college. If we control for this prior preparation, there is nonetheless a clear relationship both between Scholars' academic performance upon graduation and their participation in Summer Academy: those who attend one session of Summer Academy have an average gain of 0.058 on their GPA upon graduation ($p < 0.00001$), and those who attend two sessions of Summer Academy have an average gain of 0.197 on their GPA upon graduation ($p < 0.00001$).


```{r}
all_alums = scholar_metadata %>%
  left_join(scholar_transcripts) %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status` == "Scholar Alumni",
         `SAT Percentile` > 10) %>% # Remove outlier
  mutate(`# SA Cohorts` = factor(`# SA Cohorts`, labels = c("No SA", "1 Year", "2 Years")))
```

```{r, eval = F}
lm_all_GPA = lm(`Reported Total GPA` ~ `# SA Cohorts` + `SAT Percentile`+ log10(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`), data = all_alums)

pander(lm_all_GPA,
       caption = "Linear Regression of GPA for All Scholar Alumni",
       split.cells = c(20,20,20, 20, 20))
```

However, if we fit a natural spline (a variation of linear regression that allows for flexibility at points in the line there there is a "shift" in the relationship between the predictors and the response, Figure 7), we observe that SAT scores appear to have a very different relationship with GPA after around the 85th percentile:

```{r, fig.height = 3.3, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "left"}
library(splines)

# Get min/max values of SAT percentile using the range() function
SATlims = all_alums %>%
    select(`SAT Percentile`) %>%
    range(na.rm = T)

# Generate a sequence of SAT Math values spanning the range
SAT_grid = seq(from = min(SATlims), to = max(SATlims))

GPA_by_SAT_spline = lm(`Reported Total GPA` ~ ns(`SAT Percentile`, df = 3), data = all_alums)
pred = predict(GPA_by_SAT_spline, newdata = list(`SAT Percentile` = SAT_grid), se = TRUE)

# Compute error bands (2*SE)
se_bands = with(pred, cbind("upper" = fit+2*se.fit, 
                            "lower" = fit-2*se.fit))

# Plot the natural spline
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = all_alums, 
             aes(x = `SAT Percentile`, y = `Reported Total GPA`),
             size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = SAT_grid, y = pred$fit), color = "#0000FF") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 85), color = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 85, y = 0.7), 
            angle = 90, vjust = -0.5, size = 4,
            color = "darkgrey",
            label = "85th percentile") +
  ylab("Reported GPA") +
  xlab("Fig. 7 Natural Spline of GPA by SAT Percentile") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times"))
```

Roughly **one third of all Scholars** fall above this range (Figure 8):

```{r, fig.height = 3.1, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "left"}
all_alums %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `SAT Percentile`)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "lightblue") + 
  geom_vline( aes(xintercept = 85), 
              linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 85),
                y = 0.01, angle=90, vjust = -0.5,
                label = "85th percentile",
            size = 2.5) +
  xlab("SAT Percentile") +      # Label the x-axis
  ylab("Density") +     # Label the y-axis`
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 88, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE,
         color = FALSE) +
  ylab("Density") +
  xlab("Fig. 8 Density of SAT Percentile") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 0, hjust = .5, vjust = 0, face = "plain", family="Times"))
```

If we consider only those Scholars whose SAT Scores were **within the 75th-85th percentile**, the data tells a very different story: 

 - For Scholars with an **SAT score within the 75th-85th percentile**, we would expect to see **an average increase of 0.092** in their overall GPA upon graduation for those who attend one session of Summer Academy (more than **1.5 times as much** as the overall collection of Scholars who attend one session of Summer Academy, $p < 0.0001$).
 - For those who attend two sessions of Summer Academy, we would still expect to see **an average increase of 0.179**, comparable to that of the overall collection who attend a second session ($p < 0.01$).

```{r, eval = F}
all_alums %>%
  summarise(over80 = sum(`SAT Percentile` > 80) / n(),
            over85 = sum(`SAT Percentile` > 85) / n())

all_alums_mid_SAT = all_alums %>%
  filter(`SAT Percentile` <= 85,
         `SAT Percentile` >= 75)
  
lm_mid_SAT_GPA = lm(`Reported Total GPA` ~ `# SA Cohorts` + `SAT Percentile` + log10(`College Forbes Ranking 2018`), data = all_alums_mid_SAT)

pander(lm_mid_SAT_GPA,
       caption = "Linear Regression of GPA for 75th-80th SAT Percentile",
       split.cells = c(20,20,20, 20, 20))
```


This suggests that Scholars in this middle group are the ones that benefit most significantly from Summer Academy. However, average SAT Scores of admitted Scholars have been steadily increasing (and the range of scores decreasing) since 2016. This suggests the need for a reassessment of recruitment and admittance criteria for the program.

## Institutional Differences

The following example has insufficient sample size to merit statistical validation, but serves instead as food for thought. Consider the following two groups of institutions. The average GPA for Scholars from the 2012-2018 attending instiutions in Table \ref{table:groupA}: Group A cohorts is 3.25, and the average GPA for Scholars from the same cohorts attending instiutions in Table \ref{table:groupB}: Group B is 3.23.

```{r weirdo-schools}
SA_improvement = scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(Cohort < 2018) %>%
  mutate(`Attended SA?` = `# SA Cohorts` > 0) %>%
  group_by(`Scholar College`, `Attended SA?`) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            avgGPA = mean(`Reported Total GPA`)) %>%
  gather(variable, value, -(`Scholar College`:`Attended SA?`)) %>%
  unite(temp, `Attended SA?`, variable) %>%
  spread(temp, value) %>%
  rename(`Avg. GPA (No SA)` = FALSE_avgGPA,
         `Number Scholars (No SA)` = FALSE_n,
         `Avg. GPA (Attended SA)` = TRUE_avgGPA,
         `Number Scholars (Attended SA)` = TRUE_n) %>%
  filter(`Number Scholars (No SA)` > 2 & `Number Scholars (Attended SA)` > 2) %>%
  mutate(`SA Improved?` = ifelse(`Avg. GPA (Attended SA)` - `Avg. GPA (No SA)` >= 0.2, "Yes", 
                                 ifelse(`Avg. GPA (No SA)` - `Avg. GPA (Attended SA)` >= 0.2, "No", "")))

improved_schools = SA_improvement %>%
  filter(`SA Improved?` == "Yes") %>%
  select(`Scholar College`)

unimproved_schools = SA_improvement %>%
  filter(`SA Improved?` == "No") %>%
  select(`Scholar College`)
```


```{r }
SA_improvement %>%
  filter(`SA Improved?` == "Yes") %>%
  rename(Institution = `Scholar College`) %>%
  select(-`Number Scholars (Attended SA)`,-`Number Scholars (No SA)`, -`SA Improved?`) %>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:groupA}Group A")
```

```{r}
SA_improvement %>%
  filter(`SA Improved?` == "No") %>%
  rename(Institution = `Scholar College`) %>%
  select(-`Number Scholars (Attended SA)`,-`Number Scholars (No SA)`, -`SA Improved?`) %>%
  pander(caption = "\\label{table:groupB}Group B")
```

Observe that for instiutions in Group A, the average GPA for Scholars who attended Summer Academy is at a minimum 0.2 higher than for those who did not, and that for instiutions in Group B the opposite is true. Is this simply a numerical anomaly, or is there something setting these two groups apart that is not captured in the presently-collected data? 

## **Recommendation 1:** Establish Metrics for Post-Collegiate Success {-}
The stated mission of SCS Noonan Scholars is ``to help high-achieving low-income underrepresented students get into and graduate from top colleges **equipped to achieve their full career potential**.'' In service of this mission, it is critically important to understand not only the impact of the program in the short term, but whether or not Scholars are in fact able to reach their full career potential. Of the 355 Scholar Alumni in the dataset, 313 are presently missing values in both the \texttt{6 Months Post College: Employment Status} and \texttt{6 Months Post College: Graduate School} fields.  In order to understand the longer-term impact of the program on Scholar success, we recommend that SCS Noonan Scholars articulate clear, measurable goals for Scholars' post-undergraduate success and implement a strategy to track progress toward those goals.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
scholar_metadata %>%
  filter(`Scholar Status` == "Scholar Alumni") %>%
  group_by(is.na(`6 Months Post College: Employment Status`) & is.na(`6 Months Post College: Graduate School`)) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

## **Recommendation 2:** Report Summer Academy Course Selection {-}
Variation in content and teaching style are not captured in the current data, nor are Scholar's choice between a second course in writing or a second course in mathematics for those who attend a second session of Summer Academy. This limits the analysis to a coarse \texttt{Attended} / \texttt{Did Not Attend} level of detail which may mask many of the more subtle influences these decisions have on the relationship between Scholars' experiences at Summer Academy and their collegiate success. Should the organization decide to continue to pursue quantitative metrics in, evaluating its efficacy, it is our recommendation that SCS Noonan Scholars formulate a more rigorous data collection strategy and experimental methodology in consultation with a statistician or data scientist.

## **Recommendation 3:** Document Summer Academy Programming and Mentoring {-}
In addition to their experiences in the classroom, Summer Academy provides a unique opportunity for Scholars to develop critical competencies regarding self-advocacy, time management skills, constructive dialogue with peers, and engagement with faculty. This capacity has only been increased since the program's shift toward a residential Summer Academy beginning in 2018. In addition, the program has an impressive mentorship network (both traditional and peer) that connect Scholars to the community supports that are essential for their success in college. Despite the importance of the work being done in these areas through SCS Noonan Scholars, at present it appears that data collection on the programming and ongoing mentorship may be insufficient. As such, many of the program's most powerful mechanisms for scaffolding Scholar success remain undocumented, and so the effectiveness of these specific approaches is impossible to assess. We recommend that SCS Noonan Scholars consider establishing a protocol for tracking which Scholars are exposed to which programming, and develop a regular schedule for evaluating the impact of the specific interventions that are being employed.
